# 22.12.2022 Proccess-Based Approach: Five Project Managment Proccess Gropus
- **Initiating**: Those processes performed to define a new project or new phase of an exsiting project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.
- **Planning**: Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.
- **Execution**: Those processes performedto complete the work defined in the project management paln to satisfy the project requirments.
- **Monitoring and Controlling**: Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.
- **Closing**: Those processes performed to formally complete or close the project, phase , or contract.  
# 22.12.2022 Agile Project Management: Basics Of A User Story
- What
  - It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
- Who
  - It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
- Why
  - It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
- When
  - User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
- Create User Stories: 
  - You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.
    - “As a… I want… so that…”.
    - As a…
      - This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.
    - I want…
      - This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.
    - So that…
      - This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.
- Create a Task:
  - Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master worked with the team to determine the tasks that will be completed during the sprint?
  - Are the user story point estimates in the sprint agreed to by the team members?
  - Does everyone understand the work they need to complete during this upcoming sprint?
  - Does the workload realistically match the team’s capacity?
# 21.12.2022 Agile Mindset: Treating Software Different From Manufacturing
- Management of software is simply impossible without a very high degree of documentation. Why so much documentation:
  - 1) Enough designer must communicate with interfacing designers, which his management and possibly with the customer. A verbal record is too intangible to provide an adequate basis for an interface or management decision. An acceptable written description forces the designer to take an uniquivocal position and provide tangible evedence of completion.
  - 2) During the aerly phase of software development the documentation is the specification and is the design

# 14.12.2022 Organization Structure: How Organization Structure Affects Projects
- Hierarchy: each person reports to only one supervisor
     - PM has almost no authority
     - Functional Manager is typically in charge of things like project budget
     - Resources are hard to come by because they report to Functional Managers not PMs.
     - PM has divided responsibilities 
- Matrix: where people report to both managers and PMs
     - PM has some authority to make decision
     - Resources repoert to Two managers, Functional Manager & Project Manager
     - PM and staff work full time in a strong matrix

     - PM has almost complete authority
     - Resources are dedicated to project
     - PM and admin staff work full time

     - More customer involment
     - Small independent teams
# 14.12.2022 Process Groups: PM can be categorized into 5 Groups of Process
- Initiating: is about getting the commitment to start a project.
    - Defining the project: 
    - What’s the project supposed to accomplish?
    - What’s the scope?
    - What’s the rough estimate of Resources needed and the cost?
    - Identifying the Stakeholders and make sure they agree on what the project is.
    - Ask for Approval to proceed. 
- Planning: is where you figure out how you’re going to perform the project.
    - What are we going to do?
    - How are we going to do it?
    - How will we know when it’s done?
    - Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Monitoring and Controlling
    - Checking what’s going on the project?
    - How that compares to what you planned?
- Closing Process: this part is short but important

     - Close contracts
     - Help resources move to the their next assigments.

# 07.12.2022 Risk Management: Risk Matrix
- The Unknown
  - Remember that a risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. Risks that you are aware of are called issues.
- The Flip Side
  - Risk is not always negative. It can be positive, as well. Act on opportunities that can make the project go faster or provide greater value.
- Categorizing Risks
  - Risks can be analyzed and prioritized using the following categories:
    - Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope
    - Mitigation: Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, impact, or both
    - Transferral: Move risky work to someone else (e.g., a subcontractor via modification to their statement of work)
    - Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk (this would happen if the cost to mitigate exceeds the cost of the risk itself)
- QUESTIONS TO ASK THE TEAM
  - Can anyone spot any risks or opportunities coming down the pike?
- QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SPONSOR
  - Can your Sponsor think of any risks that might occur based on historical information or previous similar projects?
- Risk Response Planning is the process of developing options and determining actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives.
