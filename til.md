# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_11: Addressing technical project challenges
- One, would this project be best managed by traditional or agile methods and why?
- Two, there is one requirement type that will likely be very important for this project, what type do you believe it will be and why? 
- Three, what do you believe will be the area or areas of change you most need to focus on? Technical tool change, process change or cultural change and why? 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_10: Change in a technical project
- Former US president, Woodrow Wilson, is quoted as saying, "If you want to make enemies, try to change something."
-  To avoid fate, we need to focus on change in four dimensions.
	- First, there's change to the products we produce.
	- Next, focus on changing processes.
	- The third type of change to manage is system integration and maintenance changes. 
	- Finally, there is cultural or organizational change. 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_9: Requirements
- Two types of requirements: functional and non-functional.
	- Functional requirements focus on what the system needs to deliver. Non-functional requirements focus on solution characteristics and how the technical component works, such as response time or how a system would be displayed on a green or color computer terminal.
	- Non-functional requirements are sometimes referred to as technical requirements.
- Here are four areas of non-functional expectations that need to be addressed in virtually every technical project. 
	- The first area is devices and the Internet of Things
	- The second non-functional requirements area to address is 24 by seven access.
	- The third non-functional requirement area to address is accessibility.
	- Finally, there are non-functional requirements relating to search engine optimization, or SEO.   
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_8: Waterfall vs. agile
-  Here are some considerations that indicate whether traditional or Agile approaches are appropriate for your technical project
	- First is the clarity of your requirements
	- The second consideration is the product you are producing.
	- Another consideration is the need for speed and the ability to break down your product into value producing pieces.
	- Finally, your organizational norms and practices may dictate whether Waterfall or Agile is best.
# 17.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_7: Organizational Structure

- Value may be traced through several steps to ensure alignment
- Strategy
	- Core reasons for an organization's ongoing existence.
	- Described in the organization's mission and vision statement
	- Should be evident in the shared ethos and purpose of organizational staff and leadeship
- Objectives
	- Distillation of strategic vision into specefic, measureable goals
	- Objectives in this level are likely to remain high-level in nature
	- Many initiatives may be neccessary or desired in achieving objectives
- Initiatives
	- Specific portfolios, programs, and projects put in place in order to achieve objectives.
	- Each initiatives may be responssible for a part of an objective or may be targeted at accomplishing an objective on its own.
- Capabilities
	- Projects generate new capabilities that organizations use to meet objectives
	- This capabilities may be the goal or an ancillary result of project work
- Outcomes
	- New capabilities developed through initiatives provide the organization with results that may be tangible or intangible in nature.
- Benefits
	- The benefits of these outcomes may be tangible or intangible as well and could be result of initiatives, newly developed or improved capabilities, and associated outcomes of our project.
- Value 
	- Project resaults should be traceable all the way back to strategic vision in order to ensure authentic value creation.
	- Project work may influence higher levels of stack, underlining the importance of consistent alignment.
           
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_6: Risk Plan
- Your risk management plan captures the methodology or the overall approach you'll follow to manage risks.
- The plan should describe:
	- How risks will be identified, 
	- Evaluated and analyzed,
	- Documented,
	- Controlled and managed, 
	- Reported
- Good risk management plans also include the **roles and responsibilities** for team members. aslo, how to manage risk-related communication. The plan should explain how communication will happen, when, and to whom.
- This is essential to set expectations and for stakeholders to allocate the time required for their risk-related responsibilities. It's a good idea to use a matrix with a list of risk-related activities and which team members perform risk monitoring, provide input, approve, and own a given risk response activity.
- The plan should also include a glossary to make sure everyone is aware of risk-related terminology. 
- Also, the risk management plan should include the approach to **budgeting** for negative risk mitigation activities, enabling positive risk opportunities, responding if risk events occur, and planning a contingency budget.
- Finally, document how risk reviews will be performed throughout the project to make sure the risk process is effective and efficient.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_5: Volatility in a project env
- Common factors that change on a project are: 
	- Key stakeholders, 
	- Available skill levels,
	- Sponsor expectations or concerns,
	- Risks that actually do happen.
- Being prepared for a bit of volatility can help you deliver your project and keep your sanity
	- Keep a one page project purpose and status summary up to date. 
		- Outcomes your project will provide to the organization
		- The projected cost and timeframes
		- What resources each key stakeholder must contribute
		- Current status against baselines.
- Being Prepare for volatility
	- Understand available staffing options and impacts.
	- Get to know your sponsor
	- Make risk management your top priority.  
# 13.02.2023 Project Management Foundations: lesson_4: Ambiguity
- "My stakeholders don't know what they want." It's called ambiguity, when I may interpret a requirement statement to mean one thing, and a teammate reads it and understands something very different. 
- PMI talks about two types of ambiguity, **conceptual** and **situational**. 
- **Conceptual** ambiguity is when a sentence can be interpreted more than one way.
- **Situational** ambiguity is when more than one solution pathway or outcome can result from a project decision.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_3: Incorporating risk in a complex environment
- Digitization Leader and Author Pearl Zhu said, "In business, complexity both drives innovation and hinders it."
- Project complexity
	- Systems-based: approaches involve breaking down systems into small independent pieces.
		- PMI refers to this complexity reduction approach as "decoupling."  
	- Reframing: involves collecting a broad set of opinions, including opinions from people who wouldn't normally be approached, like new customers or people with experience in different industries. 
	- Process-based: These are often driven by your project methodology.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_2: Risk
- PMI defines as a lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow or solutions to pursue.
- Risks are events that can have an impact on your project but have not yet occurred. The impacts can be **positive** called **opportunities** or **negative** called **threats**.
- **Issues** are things that have already occurred on your project.
- There are four things you can do to reduce and manage risk. 
	- First, leverage your project team and key stakeholders. 
	- Second, think through possible outcomes. Look at individual tasks or groups of tasks that create one of your projects deliverables. 
	- Next consider other approaches to completing your project tasks. 
	- Finally have a plan B.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_1: Risk Glossary
- Risk category: A classification used to group identified risks.
- Risk management plan: A document that captures the processes and approaches a team will follow to manage risks in a project.
- Risk register: A tool used to identify and document a project’s potential risks and details.
- Risk standard: A term used by the Project Management Institute (PMI) that states project managers should continually evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, in order to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes.
- Uncertainty: A lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue, which will contribute to a risky project.
# 06.02.2023 Project Management: Lession 3: Project Methodologies and the Project Life Cycle

- Choosing a Project Methodology
	- Predictive
		- Clearly different work takes plac in each phase.
		- Major changes to team composition often take place at project milestones.
		- Preferred when deliverable is well undestood, based on established practices, and lacks value unit fully complete.  
	- Iterative
		- Develops product through series of repeated cycles.
		- Incremental development process with careful change management.
		- Helpful when objectives and scope are subject to change.
	- Adaptive
		- Similar to iterative model, but on a faster pace, often of 2-4 week cycles.
		- Ideal in rapidly changing environments when scope is hard to define fully in advance. 
		- Oftern used when partially completed products offer value to stakeholders as development continues.

# 22.12.2022 Agile Project Management: Basics Of A User Story
- What
  - It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
- Who
  - It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
- Why
  - It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
- When
  - User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
- Create User Stories: 
  - You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.
    - “As a… I want… so that…”.
    - As a…
      - This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.
    - I want…
      - This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.
    - So that…
      - This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.
      - As [USER], I want [Some Feature] so that I can [Get some Value].
      - As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to put my menu online so that people will be interested in my restaurant.  --- > What vs How.
- Create a Task:
  - Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master worked with the team to determine the tasks that will be completed during the sprint?
  - Are the user story point estimates in the sprint agreed to by the team members?
  - Does everyone understand the work they need to complete during this upcoming sprint?
  - Does the workload realistically match the team’s capacity?
# 21.12.2022 Agile Mindset: Treating Software Different From Manufacturing
- Management of software is simply impossible without a very high degree of documentation. Why so much documentation:
  - 1) Enough designer must communicate with interfacing designers, which his management and possibly with the customer. A verbal record is too intangible to provide an adequate basis for an interface or management decision. An acceptable written description forces the designer to take an uniquivocal position and provide tangible evedence of completion.
  - 2) During the aerly phase of software development the documentation is the specification and is the design

# 14.12.2022 Organization Structure: How Organization Structure Affects Projects
- Hierarchy: each person reports to only one supervisor
     - PM has almost no authority
     - Functional Manager is typically in charge of things like project budget
     - Resources are hard to come by because they report to Functional Managers not PMs.
     - PM has divided responsibilities 
- Matrix: where people report to both managers and PMs
     - PM has some authority to make decision
     - Resources repoert to Two managers, Functional Manager & Project Manager

# 07.12.2022 Risk Management: Risk Matrix
- Identify risk and then make them less of a proble, and then report to our boss, customer, or stakeholders what the risks are that we have not been able to get rid of. 
- **Risk Factor** = How likely they are to happen?
- **Impact Factor** = How serious they would be if they did happen?
- The Unknown
  - Remember that a risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. Risks that you are aware of are called issues.
- The Flip Side
  - Risk is not always negative. It can be positive, as well. Act on opportunities that can make the project go faster or provide greater value.
- Categorizing Risks
  - Risks can be analyzed and prioritized using the following categories:
    - Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope
    - Mitigation: Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, impact, or both
    - Transferral: Move risky work to someone else (e.g., a subcontractor via modification to their statement of work)
    - Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk (this would happen if the cost to mitigate exceeds the cost of the risk itself)
- QUESTIONS TO ASK THE TEAM
  - Can anyone spot any risks or opportunities coming down the pike?
- QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SPONSOR
  - Can your Sponsor think of any risks that might occur based on historical information or previous similar projects?
- Risk Response Planning is the process of developing options and determining actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives.

# 02.12.2022 Parking lot: Intesting Tpoics to know 
- 25/10 crowd sourcing approach
- Penny Game Agile
	- most of us cling to the notion that we could just focus on our work in a quiet office all by ourselves, we'd be much more productive. The problem is that you’re actually right but most organizations aren’t just one individual. 
	- You as an individual probably would be much more productive just working on your own tasks but as a team overall, you’d actually be less productive. You probably don’t believe me and that’s why I love penny game.
	- You’ll arrange several people around a table. These people represent members of a team or even different functional areas. Each team member has their own batch of work. To keep things simple, this work is just to fill pennies.  
	- Each team member flips pennies two at a time then pass them to a coworker. To monitor the team’s progress, you can record how long it takes each person to finish their work and how long it takes for the customer to get their first glance of the product and when it’s finished.
	- I usually run the penny game in the three rounds. For the first round, I have each person flip all 10 pennies. Remember that this is how most people prefer to work. They can just focus on all 10 pennies and when they’re done, they can hand it off to the next person. This is the equivalent of sitting in your office all day and focusing just on your own work. You can see that each person is pretty productive. Their finishing their big batches around 10 second but the customer doesn’t get their product until 52 seconds. Foe the second round, the team creates two batches of five pennies. In this smaller batch, their coworkers can start working much more quickly. Each team member doesn’t have to wait for the full handoff. They can start to work as soon as they receive their first batch. So you can see this is making each individual team member much less productive.
	- The smaller batches are slowing down each person. So now everyone is hovering around 12 seconds but the customer gets their first batch of work in only 28 seconds and then the team finished in 34 seconds. 
	- For the third round, they break their work down into five batches of two pennies so we’re getting rid of these big handoffs and keeping the team from multitasking. Everyone is focused on their own two pennies. It took each team member around 14 seconds to complete the work, four seconds longer than the batch of 10 but the customer gets to see the work dramatically faster, receiving the first glimpse in only 11 seconds and the entire product in 23 seconds, half the time of the first round. 
	- During the first round when people could focus on the entire batch, they were individually more productive but the customer
