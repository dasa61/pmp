# 18.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Your boss's management style: Lesson_8
-  What I want to suggest to you is that you ask your boss to be a better boss.
	- Weekly meeting for --> We're asking them for concrete, easy things that they could do.
	- To involve you more in their decisions, particularly if you can give them a real example of something that they recently did and they didn't involve you.
	- Another thing you could ask them for is to allow you to do something or other without having to check first.
 	- Another thing you could ask for is for them to allow you to do things without having to report afterwards.
  	- You could ask them to thank you more.
   	- Another thing you could ask your boss for is to delegate something to you.
   	- Another idea is that you might ask your boss to not sit on stuff and then suddenly give it to you once it's become urgent. 
# 18.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Personality types: Lesson_7
-  Four types of people:
	- Analytical: Top left, you've got the quiet, logical person. That's the analytical kind of engineers and accountants are quite often in that box, although not always. **You'd want to calmly go through all the details and facts with them, spreadsheets, that sort of thing.**
 	- Controllers: They're the sort of tough, decisive, you know, ballpark, just get on with it type of people. **You just want to cut to the point. You know, just three key reasons, bullet points, that sort of thing.**
  	- Enthusiasts: They are also outgoing, but they're much more emotional than the controllers. So enthusiasts love an exciting vision of the future. **Then everything's got to be fun. This is why we're doing it. You got to keep a bit of an eye on them 'cause they're quite disorganized, and just make sure that they don't drop any balls.**
   	- Amiables: These are the lovely caring people who are into things like trust and relationships and teamwork and that sort of thing.**You need to spend a bit of time with them. Get to know them, become their friend. Listen to them. Show that you actually care and make sure that they feel involved and that you're working as a kind of partnership with them.**

		- We've got two axes. And the first axis is extrovert to introvert. So we've got the really quiet people on the left and they are the ones who you would call introvert.  But they're the ones who they like to think. They like to listen rather than talk. They like lots of detail. That kind of person. The more cautious person. On the right you've got the mouthy, outgoing, decisive, just weighed in type people. And by the way, there's no right or wrong. It's just how people are.
 		- The other axis, which I've got from top to bottom. The top two I've got are the logical people. They like to have facts and reasons and numbers. And it's all down to logic. They're ruled by their head. The bottom two people are ruled by their heart. So their decision making preference is emotional. They're much more influenced by how other people feel, how they feel. So with them, they're ruled by their heart. Again, no right or wrong. People are just different.
   	- What type of person am I? which one am I at least most of the time because we can move around the boxes, of course, but you probably have a **home box**?
   		- Analytical person who loves **Detail**, **Attention to detials**, **Clever**? OR
   	 	- Controller person: I would say their strength is **decisiveness**. They're really good at making decisions. They **can function under pressure**. They **can do the tough jobs, the difficult tasks** OR
   	  	- Enthusiasts Person: I think their strengths are **vision** and obviously **enthusiasm**, the ability to **inspire other people** and also **creativity** comes from there. OR
   	  	- Amiable Person: Their strength is **relationships**. Everybody likes them. They're really **good at building up friendships**, even with customers and suppliers. They're **good listeners**, and they're **good at noticing things**. So they actually can make really good managers and leaders, and they're **good at caring**.
- Which one are you most of the time? Now, if you're stuck on this question, and you just can't think about, "oh, I just don't know," then a good question is to think **what** do you find most difficult and **who** do you find most difficult?
- Weaknesses of each types:
	- Analytical person 
		- if you're an analytical person, the weaknesses that you need to keep an eye on are that you might be too **cautious**, you know, because you hate change or uncertainty. So you'll tend to **resist changes**, and you'll resist **taking risks**, which can be a problem. Also, analyticals can't really operate without fact, and there are lots of environments in life where we don't have facts. The other problem with analyticals, sometimes, there are **oblivious to other people's moods**, **to other people's feelings**. So there is a risk that you'll be not very good at empathy, and that might be something that you want to work on and try to improve that.
  	- Controller person
  		- you might want to try **improving your patience** because controllers are often really impatient. I'm kind of laughing because this is me. I'm a controller. So, you know, trying to not be so impatient, and also controllers frighten some people because they come stamping and go, "have you done it yet? Why haven't you done it? What's the problem?" So try not to be **so scary**. I think everyone's a little bit frightened of their boss, even if their boss is really nice, but if you're a controller, there is a risk that you'll be a scary boss. So I want you to just think about that. Are you a scary boss? And also controllers **hate detail**, and sometimes that can be a problem. The other problem controllers have is they **hate being told what to do**, and (chuckles)this is so me. So controllers hate being told what to do, and if you are a controller, sometimes it's good to be told what to do. Sometimes you can learn from other people. So try to make the effort to at least give them a chance before you go, "nope, no, I'm not doing that." 
  	- Enthusiasts person
  		- what might be your areas for improvement? Well, they tend to be **disorganized**, and they **can't be bothered with detail**. So trying to make an effort to be a bit more organized, at least work with an analytical person and try to not find them too annoying (chuckles) because they will help you to become more organized, and they will probably do the detail for you, but sometimes you have to do the detail yourself. The other problem with enthusiasts is they do tend **to get bored easily**. So they flip from one thing to another, and sometimes you need a little bit of staying power to do something properly and to finish it off.
  	- Amiables person
  		-  If this is you, what do you need to do to improve? And their main issue is they're **too nice**. They tend to **avoid conflict**, and sometimes that can cost them. Sometimes you have to have the occasional bit of conflict. I think if you are a manager or a leader, sometimes you have to confront people, you know, poor performance or even just disagreements about direction. You have to fight your corner and say, "no, I think that's wrong. I think we should be doing this." So force yourself to confront people occasionally, when you're sure you're right. I think amiables also, **they don't like pressure**. They avoid any situation that involves pressure, and that can cost them too. So they don't really like dealing with unpleasant people. They **can't handle unpleasant people**, and sometimes I think you have to force yourself to deal with that unpleasant person or face up to them and deal with them. So there's some things to think about if you are an amiable.
- Which of the four types do you think you are?

# 07.06.2023 Leadership_Masterclass: Leadership self-audit: Lesson_1
-  The real essence of a great boss is about being creative. It's about thinking about better ways to do things, and about perhaps a better direction of where we're going to go in the future. So it's about creating things, and then planning how you're going to make it happen, and then about shaping the process to make sure that it does actually go in the direction that you want.

# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_11: Addressing technical project challenges
- One, would this project be best managed by traditional or agile methods and why?
- Two, there is one requirement type that will likely be very important for this project, what type do you believe it will be and why? 
- Three, what do you believe will be the area or areas of change you most need to focus on? Technical tool change, process change or cultural change and why? 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_10: Change in a technical project
- Former US president, Woodrow Wilson, is quoted as saying, "If you want to make enemies, try to change something."
-  To avoid fate, we need to focus on change in four dimensions.
	- First, there's change to the products we produce.
	- Next, focus on changing processes.
	- The third type of change to manage is system integration and maintenance changes. 
	- Finally, there is cultural or organizational change. 
# 01.05.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_9: Requirements
- Two types of requirements: functional and non-functional.
	- Functional requirements focus on what the system needs to deliver. Non-functional requirements focus on solution characteristics and how the technical component works, such as response time or how a system would be displayed on a green or color computer terminal.
	- Non-functional requirements are sometimes referred to as technical requirements.
- Here are four areas of non-functional expectations that need to be addressed in virtually every technical project. 
	- The first area is devices and the Internet of Things
	- The second non-functional requirements area to address is 24 by seven access.
	- The third non-functional requirement area to address is accessibility.
	- Finally, there are non-functional requirements relating to search engine optimization, or SEO.

- Value may be traced through several steps to ensure alignment
- Strategy
	- Core reasons for an organization's ongoing existence.
	- Described in the organization's mission and vision statement
	- Should be evident in the shared ethos and purpose of organizational staff and leadeship
- Objectives
	- Distillation of strategic vision into specefic, measureable goals
	- Objectives in this level are likely to remain high-level in nature
	- Many initiatives may be neccessary or desired in achieving objectives
- Initiatives
	- Specific portfolios, programs, and projects put in place in order to achieve objectives.
	- Each initiatives may be responssible for a part of an objective or may be targeted at accomplishing an objective on its own.
- Capabilities
	- Projects generate new capabilities that organizations use to meet objectives
	- This capabilities may be the goal or an ancillary result of project work
- Outcomes
	- New capabilities developed through initiatives provide the organization with results that may be tangible or intangible in nature.
- Benefits
	- The benefits of these outcomes may be tangible or intangible as well and could be result of initiatives, newly developed or improved capabilities, and associated outcomes of our project.

# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_6: Risk Plan
- Your risk management plan captures the methodology or the overall approach you'll follow to manage risks.
- The plan should describe:
	- How risks will be identified, 
	- Evaluated and analyzed,
	- Documented,
	- Controlled and managed, 
	- Reported
- Good risk management plans also include the **roles and responsibilities** for team members. aslo, how to manage risk-related communication. The plan should explain how communication will happen, when, and to whom.
- This is essential to set expectations and for stakeholders to allocate the time required for their risk-related responsibilities. It's a good idea to use a matrix with a list of risk-related activities and which team members perform risk monitoring, provide input, approve, and own a given risk response activity.
- The plan should also include a glossary to make sure everyone is aware of risk-related terminology. 
- Also, the risk management plan should include the approach to **budgeting** for negative risk mitigation activities, enabling positive risk opportunities, responding if risk events occur, and planning a contingency budget.
- Finally, document how risk reviews will be performed throughout the project to make sure the risk process is effective and efficient.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_5: Volatility in a project env
- Common factors that change on a project are: 
	- Key stakeholders, 
	- Available skill levels,
	- Sponsor expectations or concerns,
	- Risks that actually do happen.
- Being prepared for a bit of volatility can help you deliver your project and keep your sanity
	- Keep a one page project purpose and status summary up to date. 
		- Outcomes your project will provide to the organization
		- The projected cost and timeframes
		- What resources each key stakeholder must contribute
		- Current status against baselines.
- Being Prepare for volatility
	- Understand available staffing options and impacts.
	- Get to know your sponsor
	- Make risk management your top priority.  
# 13.02.2023 Project Management Foundations: lesson_4: Ambiguity
- "My stakeholders don't know what they want." It's called ambiguity, when I may interpret a requirement statement to mean one thing, and a teammate reads it and understands something very different. 
- PMI talks about two types of ambiguity, **conceptual** and **situational**. 
- **Conceptual** ambiguity is when a sentence can be interpreted more than one way.
- **Situational** ambiguity is when more than one solution pathway or outcome can result from a project decision.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_3: Incorporating risk in a complex environment
- Digitization Leader and Author Pearl Zhu said, "In business, complexity both drives innovation and hinders it."
- Project complexity
	- Systems-based: approaches involve breaking down systems into small independent pieces.
		- PMI refers to this complexity reduction approach as "decoupling."  
	- Reframing: involves collecting a broad set of opinions, including opinions from people who wouldn't normally be approached, like new customers or people with experience in different industries. 
	- Process-based: These are often driven by your project methodology.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_2: Risk
- PMI defines as a lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow or solutions to pursue.
- Risks are events that can have an impact on your project but have not yet occurred. The impacts can be **positive** called **opportunities** or **negative** called **threats**.
- **Issues** are things that have already occurred on your project.
- There are four things you can do to reduce and manage risk. 
	- First, leverage your project team and key stakeholders. 
	- Second, think through possible outcomes. Look at individual tasks or groups of tasks that create one of your projects deliverables. 
	- Next consider other approaches to completing your project tasks. 
	- Finally have a plan B.
# 13.02.2023 Project_Management_Foundations: lesson_1: Risk Glossary
- Risk category: A classification used to group identified risks.
- Risk management plan: A document that captures the processes and approaches a team will follow to manage risks in a project.
- Risk register: A tool used to identify and document a project’s potential risks and details.
- Risk standard: A term used by the Project Management Institute (PMI) that states project managers should continually evaluate exposure to risk, both opportunities and threats, in order to maximize positive impacts and minimize negative impacts to the project and its outcomes.
- Uncertainty: A lack of understanding and awareness of issues, events, paths to follow, or solutions to pursue, which will contribute to a risky project.
# 06.02.2023 Project Management: Lession 3: Project Methodologies and the Project Life Cycle
- **Initiation**: Business case is made Project is chrtered Core team is assembled
- **Planning**: Plans outlined for management of all aspects of the project
- **Executing**: Actual work of the project is completed Objectives and requirments are met.
- **Monitoring & Conrolling**: Project progress and performance is measured Changes are poposed where necessary to meet existing or shifting goals.
- **Closing**: confirm objectives were met. Turn over final product to customer, project sponsor, or designated recipient
- Choosing a Project Methodology
	- Predictive
		- Clearly different work takes plac in each phase.
		- Major changes to team composition often take place at project milestones.
		- Preferred when deliverable is well undestood, based on established practices, and lacks value unit fully complete.  
	- Iterative
		- Develops product through series of repeated cycles.
		- Incremental development process with careful change management.
		- Helpful when objectives and scope are subject to change.
	- Adaptive
		- Similar to iterative model, but on a faster pace, often of 2-4 week cycles.
		- Ideal in rapidly changing environments when scope is hard to define fully in advance. 
		- Oftern used when partially completed products offer value to stakeholders as development continues.

# 22.12.2022 Agile Project Management: Basics Of A User Story
- What
  - It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
- Who
  - It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
- Why
  - It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
- When
  - User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
- Create User Stories: 
  - You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.
    - “As a… I want… so that…”.
    - As a…
      - This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.
    - I want…
      - This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.
    - So that…
      - This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.
      - As [USER], I want [Some Feature] so that I can [Get some Value].
      - As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to put my menu online so that people will be interested in my restaurant.  --- > What vs How.
- Create a Task:
  - Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master worked with the team to determine the tasks that will be completed during the sprint?
  - Are the user story point estimates in the sprint agreed to by the team members?
  - Does everyone understand the work they need to complete during this upcoming sprint?
  - Does the workload realistically match the team’s capacity?
# 21.12.2022 Agile Mindset: Treating Software Different From Manufacturing
- Management of software is simply impossible without a very high degree of documentation. Why so much documentation:
  - 1) Enough designer must communicate with interfacing designers, which his management and possibly with the customer. A verbal record is too intangible to provide an adequate basis for an interface or management decision. An acceptable written description forces the designer to take an uniquivocal position and provide tangible evedence of completion.
  - 2) During the aerly phase of software development the documentation is the specification and is the design

# 14.12.2022 Organization Structure: How Organization Structure Affects Projects
- Hierarchy: each person reports to only one supervisor
     - PM has almost no authority
     - Functional Manager is typically in charge of things like project budget
     - Resources are hard to come by because they report to Functional Managers not PMs.
     - PM has divided responsibilities 
- Matrix: where people report to both managers and PMs
     - PM has some authority to make decision
     - Resources repoert to Two managers, Functional Manager & Project Manager
     - PM and staff work full time in a strong matrix
- Projectized: Where most of the people work on projects

     - More customer involment
     - Small independent teams
# 14.12.2022 Process Groups: PM can be categorized into 5 Groups of Process
- Initiating: is about getting the commitment to start a project.
    - Defining the project: 
    - What’s the project supposed to accomplish?
    - What’s the scope?
    - What’s the rough estimate of Resources needed and the cost?
    - Identifying the Stakeholders and make sure they agree on what the project is.
    - Ask for Approval to proceed. 
- Planning: is where you figure out how you’re going to perform the project.
    - What are we going to do?
    - How are we going to do it?
    - How will we know when it’s done?
    - Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Monitoring and Controlling
    - Checking what’s going on the project?

     - Document the project performance, gather lesson learnes, 
     - Close contracts
     - Help resources move to the their next assigments.

# 07.12.2022 Risk Management: Risk Matrix
- Identify risk and then make them less of a proble, and then report to our boss, customer, or stakeholders what the risks are that we have not been able to get rid of. 
- **Risk Factor** = How likely they are to happen?
- **Impact Factor** = How serious they would be if they did happen?
- The Unknown
  - Remember that a risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. Risks that you are aware of are called issues.
- The Flip Side
  - Risk is not always negative. It can be positive, as well. Act on opportunities that can make the project go faster or provide greater value.
- Categorizing Risks
  - Risks can be analyzed and prioritized using the following categories:
    - Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope
    - Mitigation: Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, impact, or both
    - Transferral: Move risky work to someone else (e.g., a subcontractor via modification to their statement of work)
    - Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk (this would happen if the cost to mitigate exceeds the cost of the risk itself)
- QUESTIONS TO ASK THE TEAM
  - Can anyone spot any risks or opportunities coming down the pike?
- QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SPONSOR
  - Can your Sponsor think of any risks that might occur based on historical information or previous similar projects?
- Risk Response Planning is the process of developing options and determining actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives.

# 02.12.2022 Parking lot: Intesting Tpoics to know 
- 25/10 crowd sourcing approach
- Penny Game Agile
	- most of us cling to the notion that we could just focus on our work in a quiet office all by ourselves, we'd be much more productive. The problem is that you’re actually right but most organizations aren’t just one individual. 
	- You as an individual probably would be much more productive just working on your own tasks but as a team overall, you’d actually be less productive. You probably don’t believe me and that’s why I love penny game.
	- You’ll arrange several people around a table. These people represent members of a team or even different functional areas. Each team member has their own batch of work. To keep things simple, this work is just to fill pennies.  
	- Each team member flips pennies two at a time then pass them to a coworker. To monitor the team’s progress, you can record how long it takes each person to finish their work and how long it takes for the customer to get their first glance of the product and when it’s finished.
	- I usually run the penny game in the three rounds. For the first round, I have each person flip all 10 pennies. Remember that this is how most people prefer to work. They can just focus on all 10 pennies and when they’re done, they can hand it off to the next person. This is the equivalent of sitting in your office all day and focusing just on your own work. You can see that each person is pretty productive. Their finishing their big batches around 10 second but the customer doesn’t get their product until 52 seconds. Foe the second round, the team creates two batches of five pennies. In this smaller batch, their coworkers can start working much more quickly. Each team member doesn’t have to wait for the full handoff. They can start to work as soon as they receive their first batch. So you can see this is making each individual team member much less productive.
	- The smaller batches are slowing down each person. So now everyone is hovering around 12 seconds but the customer gets their first batch of work in only 28 seconds and then the team finished in 34 seconds. 
	- For the third round, they break their work down into five batches of two pennies so we’re getting rid of these big handoffs and keeping the team from multitasking. Everyone is focused on their own two pennies. It took each team member around 14 seconds to complete the work, four seconds longer than the batch of 10 but the customer gets to see the work dramatically faster, receiving the first glimpse in only 11 seconds and the entire product in 23 seconds, half the time of the first round. 
	- During the first round when people could focus on the entire batch, they were individually more productive but the customer
