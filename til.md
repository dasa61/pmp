# 22.12.2022 Agile Project Management: Basics Of A User Story
- What
  - It describes a feature (or component of a feature) and is short and simple.
- Who
  - It’s from the perspective of the person who will use the feature.
- Why
  - It incorporates the “value” of the feature so the team knows what is driving this request.
- When
  - User stories are prioritized in terms of when they’ll be completed.
- Create User Stories: 
  - You and your team will create and capture user stories in a specific format.
    - “As a… I want… so that…”.
    - As a…
      - This describes who the user is. You might design a feature differently if you know that the end user is tech-savvy versus one who is not.
    - I want…
      - This expresses what the user is trying to accomplish. Understanding the feature request is critical to delivering the right thing.
    - So that…
      - This is perhaps the most critical part of the user story format. Why the user wants to accomplish something can be very enlightening to the goal just described.
      - As [USER], I want [Some Feature] so that I can [Get some Value].
      - As a restaurant owner, I want to be able to put my menu online so that people will be interested in my restaurant.  --- > What vs How.
- Create a Task:
  - Has the Scrum Master or Disciplined Agile Scrum Master worked with the team to determine the tasks that will be completed during the sprint?
  - Are the user story point estimates in the sprint agreed to by the team members?
  - Does everyone understand the work they need to complete during this upcoming sprint?
  - Does the workload realistically match the team’s capacity?
# 21.12.2022 Agile Mindset: Treating Software Different From Manufacturing
- Management of software is simply impossible without a very high degree of documentation. Why so much documentation:
  - 1) Enough designer must communicate with interfacing designers, which his management and possibly with the customer. A verbal record is too intangible to provide an adequate basis for an interface or management decision. An acceptable written description forces the designer to take an uniquivocal position and provide tangible evedence of completion.
  - 2) During the aerly phase of software development the documentation is the specification and is the design

# 14.12.2022 Organization Structure: How Organization Structure Affects Projects
- Hierarchy: each person reports to only one supervisor
     - PM has almost no authority
     - Functional Manager is typically in charge of things like project budget
     - Resources are hard to come by because they report to Functional Managers not PMs.
     - PM has divided responsibilities 
- Matrix: where people report to both managers and PMs
     - PM has some authority to make decision
     - Resources repoert to Two managers, Functional Manager & Project Manager

     - Small independent teams
# 14.12.2022 Process Groups: PM can be categorized into 5 Groups of Process
- Initiating: is about getting the commitment to start a project.
    - Defining the project: 
    - What’s the project supposed to accomplish?
    - What’s the scope?
    - What’s the rough estimate of Resources needed and the cost?
    - Identifying the Stakeholders and make sure they agree on what the project is.
    - Ask for Approval to proceed. 
- Planning: is where you figure out how you’re going to perform the project.
    - What are we going to do?
    - How are we going to do it?
    - How will we know when it’s done?
    - Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Executing: Lunching a project, bring the resources on board, get them settled in, and explain the rules you’re using to run the project.
- Monitoring and Controlling

     - Document the project performance, gather lesson learnes, 
     - Close contracts
     - Help resources move to the their next assigments.

# 07.12.2022 Risk Management: Risk Matrix
- Identify risk and then make them less of a proble, and then report to our boss, customer, or stakeholders what the risks are that we have not been able to get rid of. 
- **Risk Factor** = How likely they are to happen?
- **Impact Factor** = How serious they would be if they did happen?
- The Unknown
  - Remember that a risk is something that hasn’t happened yet. Risks that you are aware of are called issues.
- The Flip Side
  - Risk is not always negative. It can be positive, as well. Act on opportunities that can make the project go faster or provide greater value.
- Categorizing Risks
  - Risks can be analyzed and prioritized using the following categories:
    - Avoidance: Remove risky areas from the project scope
    - Mitigation: Do some risk response planning to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, impact, or both
    - Transferral: Move risky work to someone else (e.g., a subcontractor via modification to their statement of work)
    - Acceptance: Accept and deal with the risk (this would happen if the cost to mitigate exceeds the cost of the risk itself)
- QUESTIONS TO ASK THE TEAM
  - Can anyone spot any risks or opportunities coming down the pike?
- QUESTIONS TO ASK YOUR SPONSOR
  - Can your Sponsor think of any risks that might occur based on historical information or previous similar projects?
- Risk Response Planning is the process of developing options and determining actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to the project's objectives.

# 02.12.2022 Parking lot: Intesting Tpoics to know 
- 25/10 crowd sourcing approach
- Penny Game Agile
	- most of us cling to the notion that we could just focus on our work in a quiet office all by ourselves, we'd be much more productive. The problem is that you’re actually right but most organizations aren’t just one individual. 
	- You as an individual probably would be much more productive just working on your own tasks but as a team overall, you’d actually be less productive. You probably don’t believe me and that’s why I love penny game.
	- You’ll arrange several people around a table. These people represent members of a team or even different functional areas. Each team member has their own batch of work. To keep things simple, this work is just to fill pennies.  
	- Each team member flips pennies two at a time then pass them to a coworker. To monitor the team’s progress, you can record how long it takes each person to finish their work and how long it takes for the customer to get their first glance of the product and when it’s finished.
	- I usually run the penny game in the three rounds. For the first round, I have each person flip all 10 pennies. Remember that this is how most people prefer to work. They can just focus on all 10 pennies and when they’re done, they can hand it off to the next person. This is the equivalent of sitting in your office all day and focusing just on your own work. You can see that each person is pretty productive. Their finishing their big batches around 10 second but the customer doesn’t get their product until 52 seconds. Foe the second round, the team creates two batches of five pennies. In this smaller batch, their coworkers can start working much more quickly. Each team member doesn’t have to wait for the full handoff. They can start to work as soon as they receive their first batch. So you can see this is making each individual team member much less productive.
	- The smaller batches are slowing down each person. So now everyone is hovering around 12 seconds but the customer gets their first batch of work in only 28 seconds and then the team finished in 34 seconds. 
	- For the third round, they break their work down into five batches of two pennies so we’re getting rid of these big handoffs and keeping the team from multitasking. Everyone is focused on their own two pennies. It took each team member around 14 seconds to complete the work, four seconds longer than the batch of 10 but the customer gets to see the work dramatically faster, receiving the first glimpse in only 11 seconds and the entire product in 23 seconds, half the time of the first round. 
	- During the first round when people could focus on the entire batch, they were individually more productive but the customer
